## 🔒 Data Privacy & Backups

Your data is **yours**. ShopSathi stores all information directly and securely in your web browser's Local Storage. This means:
-   Your data never leaves your computer.
-   The app is incredibly fast and works offline.
-   No one else, including the developers, can access your data.

**❗️ IMPORTANT:** Because your data is stored locally, it's crucial to make regular backups. We strongly recommend enabling the **Google Drive Backup** feature to protect against data loss if you clear your browser cache or switch computers. You can also manually export a backup file from the **Settings -> Data Management** section at any time.
